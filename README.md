Our goal is to create an advanced application for both professional farmers and hobbyist gardeners to identify crop diseases. 

Using LIDAR technology and a segmentation model, we'll begin by enabling the iPhone's LIDAR scanner, to scan and diagnose diseases on individual plants. 

The resulting 3D image will be processed and displayed in an iOS app. We plan to scale up to drone and LIDAR camera technology for larger fields in the future. 

Our approach will adapt based on the technology and resources available, and we are exploring a comprehensive plant data set to inform our model.
