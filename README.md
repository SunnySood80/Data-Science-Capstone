Our solution is a novel idea that goes beyond current research. So far, the latest studies have only considered a 2D top-down view of a crop field; we aim to add an extra dimension and use advanced deep learning models to extract as much detail as possible

A crop scanning project to detect and segment diseases and interface with a mobile frontend.

Our goal is to create an advanced application for both professional farmers and hobbyist gardeners to identify crop diseases. 

Using LIDAR technology and a segmentation model, we'll begin by enabling the iPhone's LIDAR scanner, to scan and diagnose diseases on individual plants. 

The resulting 3D image will be processed and displayed in an iOS app. We plan to scale up to drone and LIDAR camera technology for larger fields in the future. 

Our approach will adapt based on the technology and resources available, and we are exploring a comprehensive plant data set to inform our model.

We've worked on a revolutionary new technique to incorporate synthetic data generation, allowing us to go from a 2D image to 3D, all with a simple Blender Python script. This gives us the ability to turn any 2D leaf picture into a 3D object for our model to train on.
